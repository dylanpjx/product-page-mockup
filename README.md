# product-page-mockup

Music application product page mock up created to practice HTML and CSS (Bootstrap). The goal was to create an intuitive and pleasant user-oriented interface using basic markup languages. 

Note that this site has no function! The buttons/links do not work and serves to be a design mock up only!

The full site screenshot can be seen at the bottom of this README.
